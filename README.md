# RNN-for-Movie-Reviews
This is a simple RNN model with early stoppings and fine-tuned parameters.
The dataset can be found from the kaggle Movie_Reviews dataset.
The model is already fine-tuned, however, if you believe that it can be modified better, please feel free to share your parameters by creating different branch. The feeatures were selected through correlation matrix, although it is a bold but time-conserving and effective approach for this case.
Hope that will help you!
